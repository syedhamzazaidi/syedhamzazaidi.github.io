## Work Experience

### Software Engineer Contractor

SALESFORCE *Oct. 2021 - Present*

- Integrating the Salesforce Einstein Bot API with DPXBot for improved AI/ML capabilities and better user experience.
- Using Postman for API development and documentation.
- Redesigning the NLP Preprocessing for the Information Retrieval models to increase the Query Resolution Rate.

### Software Engineer Intern

SALESFORCE *Jun. 2021 - Jul. 2021*

- Designed and implemented a Federated Search Information Retrieval model using Python to rank documents retrieved from multiple databases for DPXBot—an internal use Developer Productivity Slack bot. Model is currently in production.
- Designed a Natural Language Processing model to recommend documents through Semantic Textual Similarity using Word2Vec.
- Automated the testing of the Information Retrieval models against multiple datasets using a Python script with command line arguments.

## Projects

### Secure Face Recognition - Salesforce InTurn Innovate Hackathon

COMPUTER VISION *June 2021*

- Designed a seamless authentication system by coupling a face recognition model (OpenFace) with a custom liveness detection algorithm.
- The model was served using a Flask Backend with a Salesforce Lightning Web Components based Frontend.
- The custom liveness detection model captures and compares the light reflected on the face with the changing background colors on the login page through real-time statistical modelling.
- The model was shown to work against still images, videos, and deepfake spoofing attacks.
- The project won first position in the Salesforce InTurn Innovate Hackathon.

### K-Means Clustering Optimisation on Vector Space Model

INFORMATION RETRIEVAL / MACHINE LEARNING *March 2021*

- Built a Vector Space model of the Wikipedia dataset in Python.
- Optimised query search time by a factor of 100 by segmenting documents using Mini-batch K-Means clustering.
- Reduced the memory usage of the model by 99.54% by converting the Vector Space Model to an Inverted Index Model.
- Implemented lnc-ltc scoring for document ranking.

### Art Generation using Neural Style Transfer

TRANSFER LEARNING / CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS *July 2020*

- Implemented a Deep Learning model to extract the artistic style from an image, the content from another, and blend them together to generate a new image using Tensorflow, following the paper titled ‘A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style’ by Leon A. Gatys, et al.
- Implemented a grid-search algorithm to find the optimal hyperparameter values.
